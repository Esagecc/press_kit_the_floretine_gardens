        <h1>DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT</h1>
        <p>The Black Dahlia is a legend that fascinated me for years. It is the most haunting tragedy of A Hollywood Dame whose life was cut short in a gruesome manner. We know details of her murder and the list of suspects that the LA homicide detectives pursued. But who is Elizabeth Short?</p>
        <p>After researching her life, I saw a strong woman that has been overlooked due to the chauvinism of that time. Her innocent and vivaciousness drew us to her pictures. She was more than another girl in Hollywood. She was a beautiful drifter with hope. She was independent, resourceful, charming, and sometimes mischievous. She was modern woman ahead of her time.</p> 
        <p>Elizabeth had many different dimensions and many different angles as a human being. She was looking for happiness and yearning for joy. I am determined to bring her story to life.</p>
        <p>This short is about Elizabeth’s experience living at the Florentine Gardens Apartment and she should be remembered for her true smile.</p>

                        <p>Robert Cantu was born in Corpus Christi, TX, and raised in Houston, TX. In 1998, he lived to Los Angeles and he started out as a still photographer on countless student and amateur films. He got more hands-on experience as a boom operator, PA, and working in the grip department. With his knowledge, he produced his first short film “5150”, an inspired film from Stanley Kubrick’s 2001, and it was entered in numerous film festivals. He continued to volunteer on film sets and then in 2001, he produced and directed “The Barista”. In 2003, Robert produced and directed an ego time bomb detective with no moral principles, “Detective Grgich”, a noir film. In 2004, his first real short film “Suspended Homicide” met his professional standard and he directed with greater confidence. He has written my first full-length screenplay “corpus FUSION”. He writes three more full-length screenplays: “Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry”, “Silent Motive” and “JASONLAND”. In 2019, Robert produced and directed a horror short film, “Jason Z”. A Youtube released was on June 13, 2019. By 2020, Robert produced and directed two short Noir films, “The Florentine Gardens” and “Homicidal Crimes”. Both are post-production and are pending release. </p>
